# Landing Page Images

Place the following three images in this directory:

1. `find-tag-step1.png` - Step 1: Select player name
2. `find-tag-step2.png` - Step 2: Select player tag  
3. `find-tag-step3.png` - Step 3: Copy Tag

Once you add these images, uncomment the Image components in `app/page.tsx` (lines 47-52, 67-72, and 87-92) to display them.

The images should be in a 3:4 aspect ratio (portrait orientation) to match the mobile game screenshots.
